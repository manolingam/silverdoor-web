      'Silver Door was born out of necessity. We closed our first equity partnership the day we founded Silver Door. We needed Silver Door to abstract away the complexities of business deals and allow us to do what we do best; build. The Silver Door Co-op allowed us to wield our collective bargaining power to get better results for our members. We are the threshold where engineers and visionary founders unite to solve challenging problems and build stellar products.'
